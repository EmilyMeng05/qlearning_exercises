# qlearning_exercises
I created this github repo for people to try out different familiar games using qlearning

Under games folder: 
I created two games: connect four and tic tac toe

Under qlearning folder: 
I created qlearner files for connect four and tic tac toe

Not done: 
I haven't create a main.py yet and I didn't find a way to visualize the qlearning too
